    api_description: is designed to provide reliable, many-to-many, asynchronous messaging between applications. Publisher applications can send messages to a topic and other applications can subscribe to that topic to receive the messages. By decoupling senders and receivers, Google Cloud Pub/Sub allows developers to communicate between independently written applications.
